Features
==
- **Add Name**: Type “+” and the text to add at the end of the layer name (e.g., + button).

- **Sequence**:  Type “%N” to name layer in sequence. You can also use “%n” for reverse order. The more Ns you add the more digits it will add (e.g. , Item %N ==> Item 1, Item 2, Item 3).

- **Move Original Text**: Type "\*" to keep the original anywhere in the new name (e.g., Option \* icon).

- **Add Width and Height**: Type "%w" or "%h" to add the width or height of the layer  (e.g., Icon %w x %h). *Great addition by @GU5TAF*

- **Alphabetical Letters Sequence**: Type "%a" or "%A" (for uppercase letters) to name layers with letters alphabetically. (e.g., Item %a ==> Item a, Item b, Item c)
